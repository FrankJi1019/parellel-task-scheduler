# Meeting Minutes 26/09

0. The program has been able to generate solution tree for small graphs (brute-force algorithm). Can only generate the tree for a complex graph if the amount of processor is 1, otherwise will throw `OutOfMemoryError`
1. Discussed about refactoring the code: create our own `Vertex` class that extends from `SingleNode` of `graph stream api`, to allow us to add customized methods.
